# Demonstration of 4Da weight resolution (experimental data)
Here we experimentally demonstrate that a heptameric FraC pore can discern 
protein weights with a resolution of 4Da. Data and analysis scripts for the
reproduction of supplementary image XXX or our paper are included in this
folder. To repeat analysis, first build and activate the included conda
environment (assuming this folder as root):
```
conda env create -f env.yaml
conda activate cnd_labdata
```
The included jupyter notebook can then be run:
```
jupyter notebook 4Da_separation_of_YGGFM_and_YAGFL.ipynb
```
